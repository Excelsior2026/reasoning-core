Today we're discussing acute myocardial infarction, commonly known as a heart attack.

A 65-year-old male patient presents to the emergency department with acute onset chest pain.
The pain is described as crushing, substernal, radiating to the left arm and jaw.
The patient also reports shortness of breath and diaphoresis.

On examination, vital signs show tachycardia with heart rate of 105 bpm and blood pressure of 160/95 mmHg.
The patient appears anxious and in moderate distress.

We immediately order an ECG, which reveals ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF,
consistent with an inferior wall myocardial infarction.

Laboratory tests show elevated troponin levels at 5.2 ng/mL, confirming myocardial damage.
D-dimer is normal, ruling out pulmonary embolism.

The diagnosis is acute inferior wall myocardial infarction, a medical emergency requiring immediate intervention.

Treatment is initiated with aspirin 325mg chewed, clopidogrel loading dose,
unfractionated heparin, and nitroglycerin for chest pain relief.

The patient is prepared for emergent cardiac catheterization to identify and treat the blocked coronary artery.
This is a time-critical intervention - "time is muscle" as we say in cardiology.

Post-procedure, the patient will be started on beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, and statins
for secondary prevention of future cardiac events.

Regular monitoring of cardiac biomarkers and ECG changes is essential during the hospital stay.
