The Theory of Relativity, developed by Albert Einstein, fundamentally changed our understanding
of space, time, and gravity.

Einstein published the Special Theory of Relativity in 1905, introducing the concept that
the laws of physics are the same for all non-accelerating observers.

The famous equation E=mc² demonstrates the relationship between mass and energy,
showing that mass and energy are interchangeable.

Ten years later, in 1915, Einstein completed the General Theory of Relativity,
which describes gravity not as a force, but as a curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy.

These theories have profound implications for our understanding of the universe,
from the behavior of GPS satellites to the existence of black holes.

The Theory of Relativity continues to be validated through astronomical observations
and experimental physics, cementing Einstein's legacy as one of history's greatest scientists.
