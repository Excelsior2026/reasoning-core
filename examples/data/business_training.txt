Welcome to our advanced sales training on customer pain point identification and value-based selling.

The most common pain point we encounter is inefficiency in the prospect's current workflow.
Customers are spending too much time on manual processes, leading to decreased productivity and increased costs.

Our discovery process uses the MEDDIC framework to qualify opportunities.
We identify Metrics, Economic buyer, Decision criteria, Decision process, Identify pain, and Champion.

When addressing the inefficiency pain point, we demonstrate how our solution provides automation
and streamlines their workflow, directly impacting their conversion rate and ROI.

Objection handling is critical. When prospects say "it's too expensive," we pivot to value.
We show how the investment pays for itself through improved efficiency and cost savings.

Our upselling strategy focuses on expanding value within existing accounts.
We measure success through key metrics: Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC), Lifetime Value (LTV),
and Net Promoter Score (NPS).

The sales process follows these stages: prospecting, qualification, discovery, demo, proposal, negotiation, and closing.

Remember, we're not selling features - we're selling business outcomes.
Every feature should map to a tangible benefit that addresses a specific pain point.

After closing, the onboarding process is crucial for customer retention and future expansion opportunities.
Track revenue growth, churn rate, and expansion revenue as key performance indicators.
